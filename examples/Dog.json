is a [[Gray_wolf_subspecies]] the [[Gray_wolf]] (Canis lupus), a member of the [[Canidae]] family of the mammilian order [[Carnivora]]. The term \"domestic dog\" is generally used for both [[Domesticated]] and [[Feral]] varieties. The dog may have been the first animal to be domesticated, and has been the most widely kept [[Working_dog]], [[Hunting]], and [[Pet]] in human history. The word \"dog\" may also mean the male of a canine species,[4] as opposed to the word \"bitch\" for the female of the species.The present lineage of dogs was domesticated from gray wolves about 15,000 years ago.[5] Though remains of domesticated dogs have been found in Siberia and Belgium from about 33,000 years ago, none of those lineages seem to have survived the [[Last_Glacial_Maximum]]. Although mDNA testing suggests a split between dogs and wolves around 100,000 years ago, no specimens prior to 33,000 years ago are clearly morphologically domesticated dog.[6][7][8]Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as [[Hunting_dog]], [[Herding_dog]], [[Sled_dog]], [[Guard_dog]], [[Police_dog]] and [[Dogs_in_warfare]], [[Pet]], and, more recently, [[Service_dog]]. This impact on human society has given them the nickname \"Man's Best Friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, dogs are also source of meat.[9][10] In 2001, there were estimated to be 400Â million dogs in the world.[11]Most breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular [[Morphology_(biology)]] and [[Dog_behavior]] by people for specific functional roles. Through this [[Artificial_selection]], the dog has developed into hundreds of varied [[Dog_breed]], and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[12] For example, height measured to the [[Withers]] ranges from 6 inches (150Â mm) in the [[Chihuahua_(dog)]] to about 2.5 feet (0.76Â m) in the [[Irish_Wolfhound]]; color varies from white through grays (usually called \"blue\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in a wide variation of patterns; [[Coat_(dog)]] can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[13] It is common for most breeds to [[Moult]] this coat.","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/YellowLabradorLooking_new.jpg/260px-YellowLabradorLooking_new.jpg"]},"Etymology and related terminology":{"text":"\"Dog\" is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies Canis lupus familiaris (canis, \"dog\"; lupus, \"wolf\"; familiaris, \"of a household\" or \"domestic\"). The term can also be used to refer to a wider range of related species, such as the members of the genus Canis, or \"true dogs\", including the [[Wolf]], [[Coyote]], and [[Jackal]], or it can refer to the members of the [[Tribe_(biology)]] [[Canidae#Species_and_taxonomy]], which would also include the [[African_wild_dog]], or it can be used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which would also include the [[Fox]], [[Bush_dog]], [[Raccoon_dog]], and others.[14] Some members of the family have \"dog\" in their common names, such as the raccoon dog and the African wild dog. A few animals have \"dog\" in their common names but are not canids, such as the [[Prairie_dog]].The English word \"dog\" comes from [[Middle_English]] dogge, from [[Old_English]] [[//en.wiktionary.orgdocga]], a \"powerful dog breed\".[15] The term may derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkÅn, represented in Old English finger-docce (\"finger-muscle\").[16] The word also shows the familiar petname [[Diminutive]] -ga also seen in frogga \"frog\", picga \"pig\", stagga \"stag\", wicga \"beetle, worm\", among others.[17] Due to the archaic structure of the word, the term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the role of the dog as the earliest [[List_of_domesticated_animals]].[18]In 14th-century England, \"[[Hound]]\" (from [[Old_English_language]]: hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and \"dog\" referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this \"dog\" type of \"hound\" was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category âhoundâ.[19] By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.[20] Hound, [[Cognate_(etymology)]] to German Hund, Dutch hond, common Scandinavian hund, and Icelandic hundur, is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European *kwon- \"dog\", found in [[Welsh_language]] ci (plural cwn), [[Latin]] canis, [[Greek_language]] kÃ½Ån, and [[Lithuanian_language]] Å¡uÃµ.[21]In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja). A group of offspring is a [[Litter_(animal)]]. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or [[Puppy]], from French poupÃ©e, until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valpa, Icelandic hvelpur).[22]","images":[]},"Taxonomy":{"text":"In 1753, the father of modern biological taxonomy, [[Carl_Linnaeus]], listed among the types of [[Quadruped]] familiar to him, the Latin word for dog, canis. Among the species within this genus, Linnaeus listed the [[Fox]], as Canis vulpes, [[Wolves]] (Canis lupus), and the domestic dog, (Canis canis; see [[File:Linnaeus_-_Regnum_Animale_(1735).png]]).In later editions, Linnaeus dropped Canis canis and greatly expanded his list of the Canis genus of quadrupeds, and by 1758 included alongside the foxes, wolves, and [[Canis_aureus]] and many more terms that are now listed as synonyms for domestic dog, including aegyptius (hairless dog), aquaticus, ([[Water_dog]]), and mustelinus (literally â[[Badger_dog]])â. Among these were two that later experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a species: Canis domesticus and, most predominantly, Canis familiaris, the âcommonâ or âfamiliarâ dog.[23]The domestic dog was accepted as a species in its own right until overwhelming evidence from behavior, vocalizations, morphology, and [[Molecular_biology]] led to the contemporary scientific understanding that a single species, the gray wolf, is the [[Common_descent]] for all breeds of domestic dogs.[24][25][26] In recognition of this fact, the domestic dog was reclassified in 1993 as Canis lupus familiaris, a subspecies of the gray wolf Canis lupus, by the [[Smithsonian_Institution]] and the [[American_Society_of_Mammalogists]]. C. l. familiaris is listed as the name for the taxon that is broadly used in the scientific community and recommended by [[ITIS]], although Canis familiaris is a recognised synonym.[27]Since that time, C. domesticus and all taxa referring to domestic dogs or subspecies of dog listed by Linnaeus, [[Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin]] in 1792, and [[Christian_Smith]] in 1839, lost their subspecies status and have been listed as [[Taxonomic_synonym]] for Canis lupus familiaris [28]","images":[]},"History and evolution":{"text":"Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf ancestors, which would have been [[Pack_hunter]] with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.[24]Although experts largely disagree over the details of [[Dog_domestication]], it is agreed that human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies.[29] Domestication may have occurred initially in separate areas particularly Siberia and Europe. Currently it is thought domestication of our current lineage of dog occurred sometime as early as 15,000 years ago and arguably as late as 8500 years ago. Shortly after the latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human populations, and spread throughout the world.Emigrants from [[Siberia]] likely crossed the [[Bering_Strait]] with dogs in their company, and some experts[[[Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words]]] suggest the use of [[Sled_dogs]] may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago,[[[Wikipedia:Citation_needed]]] although the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,000 years ago.[30] Dogs were an important part of life for the [[Athabaskan_languages]] population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load in the migration of the [[Apache]] and [[Navajo_people]] tribes 1,400 years ago. Use of dogs as [[Pack_animal]] in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the [[Horse]] to North America.[31][[[Wikipedia:Citing_sources]]]The current consensus among biologists and archaeologists is that the dating of first domestication is indeterminate,[29][31] although more recent evidence shows isolated domestication events as early as 33,000 years ago.[32][33] There is conclusive evidence the present lineage of dogs genetically diverged from their wolf ancestors at least 15,000 years ago,[5][34][35] but some believe domestication to have occurred earlier.[29] Evidence is accruing that there were previous domestication events, but that those lineages died out.[7]It is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as such to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or whether dog's evolutionary path had already taken a different course prior to domestication. For example, it is hypothesized that some wolves gathered around the campsites of paleolithic camps to scavenge refuse, and associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored those who were less frightened by, and keener in approaching, humans.The bulk of the scientific evidence for the evolution of the domestic dog stems from morphological studies of archaeological findings and [[Mitochondrial_DNA]] studies. The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years ago,[24][31] and some genetic evidence indicates the domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in the late [[Upper_Paleolithic]] close to the [[Pleistocene]]/[[Holocene]] boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago.[36] But there is a wide range of other, contradictory findings that make this issue controversial.[[[Wikipedia:Citation_needed]]] There are findings beginning currently at 33,000 years ago distinctly placing them as domesticated dogs evidenced not only by shortening of the muzzle but widening as well as crowding of teeth.Archaeological evidence suggests the latest dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged much earlier.[24] In 2008, a team of international scientists released findings from an excavation at Goyet Cave in Belgium declaring a large, toothy canine existed 31,700 years ago and ate a diet of horse, [[Musk_ox]] and reindeer.[37]Prior to this Belgian discovery, the earliest dog fossils were two large skulls from Russia and a [[Mandible]] from Germany dated from roughly 14,000 years ago.[5][24] Remains of smaller dogs from [[Natufian_culture]] cave deposits in the Middle East, including the earliest burial of a human being with a domestic dog, have been dated to around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.[5][38] There is a great deal of archaeological evidence for dogs throughout Europe and Asia around this period and through the next two thousand years (roughly 8,000 to 10,000 years ago), with fossils uncovered in Germany, the French Alps, and Iraq, and [[Cave_painting]] in Turkey.[24] The oldest remains of a domesticated dog in the Americas were found in Texas and have been dated to about 9,400 years ago.[39]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Aleria%2C_Rhyton%2C_t%C3%AAte_de_chien.jpg/200px-Aleria%2C_Rhyton%2C_t%C3%AAte_de_chien.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Rhyton_en_forme_de_t%C3%AAte_de_chien.jpg/167px-Rhyton_en_forme_de_t%C3%AAte_de_chien.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Rhyton_en_forme_de_t%C3%AAte_de_chien2.jpg/115px-Rhyton_en_forme_de_t%C3%AAte_de_chien2.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Tesem2.jpg/220px-Tesem2.jpg"]},"DNA studies":{"text":"DNA studies have provided a wide range of possible divergence dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago,[5] to as much as 100,000 to 140,000 years ago.[40] These results depend on a number of assumptions.[24] Genetic studies are based on comparisons of [[Genetic_diversity]] between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an estimated wolf-coyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 years ago as a calibration.[41] If this estimate is incorrect, and the actual wolf-coyote divergence is closer to one or two million years ago, or more,[42] then the DNA evidence that supports specific dog-wolf divergence dates would be interpreted very differently.Furthermore, it is believed the genetic diversity of wolves has been in decline for the last 200 years, and that the genetic diversity of dogs has been reduced by [[Selective_breeding]]. This could significantly bias DNA analyses to support an earlier divergence date. The genetic evidence for the domestication event occurring in East Asia is also subject to violations of assumptions. These conclusions are based on the location of maximal [[Genetic_divergence]], and assume hybridization does not occur, and that breeds remain geographically localized. Although these assumptions hold for many species, there is good reason to believe that they do not hold for canines.[24]Genetic analyses indicate all dogs are likely descended from a handful of domestication events with a small number of founding females,[24][36] although there is evidence domesticated dogs [[Introgression]] of wild wolves on several occasions.[5] Data suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout the world, reaching the North American continent around 8000 BC.[5] The oldest groups of dogs, which show the greatest [[Genetic_variability]] and are the most similar to their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African breeds, including the [[Basenji]], [[Lhasa_Apso]], and [[Siberian_Husky]].[43] Some breeds thought to be very old, such as the [[Pharaoh_Hound]], [[Ibizan_Hound]], and [[Norwegian_Elkhound]], are now known to have been created more recently.[43]A great deal of controversy surrounds the evolutionary framework for the domestication of dogs.[24] Although it is widely claimed that \"man domesticated the wolf,\"[44] man may not have taken such a proactive role in the process.[24] The nature of the interaction between man and wolf that led to domestication is unknown and controversial. At least three early species of the Homo genus began spreading out of Africa roughly 400,000 years ago, and thus lived for a considerable time in contact with canine species.[24]Despite this, there is no evidence of any adaptation of canine species to the presence of the close relatives of modern man. If dogs were domesticated, as believed, roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would have coincided with a large expansion in human territory and the development of agriculture. This has led some biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in the form of established human settlements. Permanent settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of disposable food and would have created a barrier between wild and anthropogenic canine populations.[24]","images":[]},"Roles with humans":{"text":"","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Siberian_Husky_pho_.jpg/220px-Siberian_Husky_pho_.jpg"]},"Early roles":{"text":"Wolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human campsâmore safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.[45] They would have benefited from humansâ upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.[45] Camp dogs would also have benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.[45]Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.[46] For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.[46] Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression âthree dog nightâ (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.[46]Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' sensitive sense of smell to assist with the hunt.[46] The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.[47]The cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.[48]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Family_pet.jpg/220px-Family_pet.jpg"]},"As pets":{"text":"\"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs\"[46] and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.[49] However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[49] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today [50] (using the expression âin the doghouseâ to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, childrenâs playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their owners.[51] People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each otherâs lives,[52] to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.[53]There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the âcommodificationâ of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.[53] The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[53]There are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[54] The list of goods, services and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and care-takers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.[54] While [[Dog_training]] as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal [[Dog_behavior]] such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and [[Spraying_(animal_behavior)]][[[Wikipedia:Please_clarify]]] became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.[55] Dog training books, classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.[56]The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their dog as part of the family,[53] although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack.[53] A [[Dominance_(ethology)]] model of dog-human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program [[Dog_Whisperer]]. However it has been disputed that \"trying to achieve status\" is characteristic of dogâhuman interactions.[57] Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions with each other.[58]Another study of dogsâ roles in families showed many dogs have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members, the most common of which was helping with the washing-up by licking the plates in the dishwasher, and bringing in the newspaper from the lawn.[53] Increasingly, human family members are engaging in activities centred on the perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as [[Musical_canine_freestyle]] and [[Doga_(Dog_Yoga)]].[54]According to the statistics published by the [[American_Pet_Products_Manufacturers_Association]] in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009â2010, it is estimated there are 77.5Â million dog owners in the United States.[59] The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets.

The group without pets exhibited no statistically significant changes in health or behaviour. The results provide evidence that pet acquisition may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for dog owners these effects are relatively long term.[91] Pet ownership has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with dog owners being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.[92]The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs, not just from dog ownership. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.[93] Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the [[Hygiene_hypothesis]], can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.[94] One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[95]The practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.[96] Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase a person with Alzheimerâs diseaseâs social behaviours, such as smiling and laughing.[97] One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared to those who were not in an animal-assisted program.[98]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Puppy_near_Coltani_-_17_apr_2010.jpg/220px-Puppy_near_Coltani_-_17_apr_2010.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Gunnar_Kaasen_with_Balto.jpg/200px-Gunnar_Kaasen_with_Balto.jpg"]},"Shelters":{"text":"Every year, between 6 and 8Â million dogs and cats enter US [[Animal_shelter]].[99] The [[Humane_Society_of_the_United_States]] (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4Â million of those dogs and cats are [[Animal_euthanasia]] yearly in the United States.[100] However, the percentage of dogs in US animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed from the shelters by their new owners has increased since the mid 1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 40% among reporting shelters[101] (and many shelters reporting 60â75%) [102].","images":[]},"Biology":{"text":"Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[3] Modern [[Dog_breed]] show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.

Humans, by comparison, require a change of between 10 and 20 diopters to detect movement.[110][111]As [[Crepuscular]] hunters, dogs often rely on their vision in low light situations: They have very large pupils, a high density of [[Rod_cell]] in the [[Fovea]], an increased flicker rate, and a [[Tapetum_lucidum]].[105] The tapetum is a reflective surface behind the retina that reflects light to give the photoreceptors a second chance to catch the photons. There is also a relationship between body size and overall diameter of the eye. A range of 9.5 and 11.6Â mm can be found between various breeds of dogs. This 20% variance can be substantial and is associated as an adaptation toward superior night vision.[112]The eyes of different breeds of dogs have different shapes, dimensions, and retina configurations.[113] Many long-nosed breeds have a \"visual streak\" â a wide foveal region that runs across the width of the retina and gives them a very wide field of excellent vision. Some [[Cephalic_index#Dolichocephalic_animals]] breeds, in particular, the [[Sighthound]], have a field of vision up to 270Â° (compared to 180Â° for humans). Short-nosed breeds, on the other hand, have an \"area centralis\": a central patch with up to three times the density of nerve endings as the visual streak, giving them detailed sight much more like a human's. Some [[Cephalic_index#Brachycephalic_animals]] breeds with short noses have a field of vision similar to that of humans.[106][107]Most breeds have [[Emmetropic]], but some show a [[Genetic_predisposition]] for [[Myopia]] â such as [[Rottweiler]], with which one out of every two has been found to be myopic.[105] Dogs also have a greater divergence of the eye axis than humans, enabling them to rotate their pupils farther in any direction. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12â25Â° depending on the breed.[110]Experimentation has proven that dogs can distinguish between complex visual images such as that of a cube or a prism. Dogs also show attraction to static visual images such as the silhouette of a dog on a screen, their own reflections, or videos of dogs; however, their interest declines sharply once they are unable to make social contact with the image.[114]The frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40Â Hz to 60,000Â Hz,[115] which means that dogs can detect sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory spectrum.[107][115][116] In addition, dogs have ear mobility, which allows them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound.[117] Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear. A dog can identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, as well as hear sounds at four times the distance.[117]While the human brain is dominated by a large [[Visual_cortex]], the dog brain is dominated by an [[Olfactory_system]].[105] The [[Olfactory_bulb]] in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative to total brain size, with 125 to 220Â million smell-sensitive receptors.[105] The [[Bloodhound]] exceeds this standard with nearly 300Â million receptors.[105]Consequently, it has been estimated that dogs, in general, have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human's. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human's.[118] The wet nose is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air currents.[119]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Auge_Hund_Diagramm_engl.jpg/300px-Auge_Hund_Diagramm_engl.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Anatomy_and_physiology_of_animals_The_ear.jpg/250px-Anatomy_and_physiology_of_animals_The_ear.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Dog_nose.jpg/220px-Dog_nose.jpg"]},"Physical characteristics":{"text":"The [[Pelage]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[Guard_hair]] and a soft [[Down_hair]], or \"single\", with the topcoat only.Domestic dogs often display the remnants of [[Countershading]], a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,[120] which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside.[121]There are many different shapes for dog [[Tail]]: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally [[Docking_(dog)]] to avoid injuries.[122] In some breeds, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.[123]Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,[173] as well as proportionately smaller teeth than other canid species.[174] Dogs require fewer calories to function than wolves. It is thought by certain experts that the dog's limp ears are a result of [[Atrophy]] of the jaw muscles.[174] The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some [[Inuit]] tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.[174]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Poligraf_Poligrafovich.JPG/220px-Poligraf_Poligrafovich.JPG"]},"Types and breeds":{"text":"While all dogs are genetically very similar,[5] [[Natural_selection]] and selective breeding have reinforced certain characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad categories based on function, genetics, or characteristics.[124] Dog breeds are groups of animals that possess a set of inherited characteristics that distinguishes them from other animals within the same species. Modern dog breeds are non-scientific classifications of dogs kept by modern [[Kennel_club]].Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from [[Purebred_(dog)]] dogs of other breeds,[43] but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic. Systematic analyses of the dog genome has revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said to be statistically distinct.[43] These include the \"old world dogs\" (e.g., [[Alaskan_Malamute]] and [[Shar_Pei]]), \"Mastiff\"-type (e.g., [[English_Mastiff]]), \"herding\"-type (e.g., [[Border_Collie]]), and \"all others\" (also called \"modern\"- or \"hunting\"-type).[43][125]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Cavalier_King_Charles_Spaniel_trio.jpg/220px-Cavalier_King_Charles_Spaniel_trio.jpg"]},"Health":{"text":"Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, [[Zoonosis]]. To defend against many common diseases, dogs are often [[Vaccination_of_dogs]].Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as [[Elbow_dysplasia]] or [[Hip_dysplasia_(canine)]], [[Blindness]], [[Deafness]], [[Pulmonary_valve_stenosis]], [[Cleft_lip_and_palate]], and [[Luxating_patella]]. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are [[Pyometra]], affecting [[Neutering]] females of all types and ages, and [[Bloat]], which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as [[Flea]], [[Tick]], and [[Mite]], as well as [[Hookworm]], [[Cestoda]], [[Nematode]], and [[Dirofilaria_immitis]].Dogs are highly susceptible to [[Theobromine_poisoning]], typically from ingestion of [[Chocolate]]. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including [[Diabetes_in_dogs]], dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.[126]The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[127][128][129][130] Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size) is the [[Dogue_de_Bordeaux]], with a median longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, including [[Bull_Terrier_(Miniature)]], [[Bloodhound]], and [[Irish_Wolfhound]] are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.[130]The longest-lived breeds, including [[Toy_Poodles]], [[Japanese_Spitz]], [[Border_Terrier]], and [[Tibetan_Spaniel]], have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.[130] The median longevity of [[Mixed-breed_dog]], taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[128][129][130][131] The dog widely reported to be the longest-lived is \"[[Bluey_(dog)]],\" who died in 1939 and was claimed to be 29.5 years old at the time of his death; however, the Bluey record is anecdotal and unverified.[132] On December 5, 2011, [[Pusuke]], the world's oldest living dog recognized by [[Guinness_Book_of_World_Records]], died aged 26 years and 9 months.[133]Although wild dogs, like wolves, are [[Apex_predator]], they can be killed in [[Territory_(animal)]] disputes with wild animals.[134] Furthermore, in areas where both dogs and other large predators live, dogs can be a major food source for big cats or canines. Reports from Croatia indicate wolves kill dogs more frequently than they kill sheep. Wolves in Russia apparently limit feral dog populations. In Wisconsin, more compensation has been paid for dog losses than livestock.[134] Some wolf pairs have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal waits in ambush.[135] In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they[[[Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words]]] have to be beaten off or killed.[136][[Coyote]] and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. [[Leopard]] in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of the dog's size or ferocity.[137] [[Tiger]] in Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards.[138] [[Striped_Hyena]] are major predators of village dogs in Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus.[139] Reptiles such as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat dogs.","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Terrier_mixed-breed_dog.jpg/220px-Terrier_mixed-breed_dog.jpg"]},"Diet":{"text":"Despite their descent from wolves and classification as [[Carnivora]], dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as [[Carnivore]][140][141] or [[Omnivore]].[3][142][143][144] Unlike [[Obligate_carnivore]], such as the [[Felidae]] with its shorter [[Small_intestine]], dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements. Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet.[3]A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including [[Chocolate]] ([[Theobromine_poisoning]]), onion and [[Garlic]] ([[Thiosulphate]], [[Sulfoxide]] or [[Disulfide]] poisoning),[145] [[Grape]] and [[Raisin]], [[Macadamia_nut]], as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.[146][147]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Golden_retriever_eating_pigs_foot.jpg/170px-Golden_retriever_eating_pigs_foot.jpg"]},"Reproduction":{"text":"In domestic dogs, [[Puberty]] begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,[3][148] although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first [[Estrous_cycle]]. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles biannually, during which the body prepares for [[Pregnancy]]. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to [[Sexual_intercourse]].[3] Because the [[Ovum]] survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.[3]Dogs bear their litters roughly 56 to 72 days after [[Fertilization]],[3][149] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six [[Puppy]],[150] though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, [[Toy_dog]] produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male [[French_Bulldog]], for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be [[Artificial_insemination]] in order to reproduce.[151]","images":[]},"Neutering":{"text":"[[Neutering]] refers to the [[Neutering]] of animals, usually by removal of [[Male_dog]] or the female's [[Ovary]] and [[Uterus]], in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce [[Sex_drive]]. Because of the [[Overpopulation_in_companion_animals]] in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the [[American_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals]] (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.[152]According to the [[Humane_Society_of_the_United_States]], 3â4Â million dogs and cats are [[Euthanasia]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[153] Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other [[Animal_protection_organizations]] urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.Neutering reduces problems caused by [[Hypersexuality]], especially in male dogs.[154] Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[155] However, neutering increases the risk of [[Urinary_incontinence]] in female dogs,[156] and [[Prostate_cancer]] in males,[157] as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either gender.[158]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Wilde_huendin_am_stillen.jpg/220px-Wilde_huendin_am_stillen.jpg"]},"Intelligence":{"text":"The domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.[105] Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as through simple [[Reinforcement_learning]] (e.g., [[Classical_conditioning]] or [[Operant_conditioning]]) and by observation.[105]Dogs go through a series of stages of cognitive development. As with [[Human]], the understanding that objects not being actively perceived still remain in existence (called [[Object_permanence]]) is not present at birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks of age.[105]Puppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set by experienced dogs.[105] This form of intelligence is not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies that watched an experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those left to solve the problem on their own.[105][159]Dogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three-quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.[160] Another study found that handing an object between experimenters who then used the object's name in a sentence successfully taught an observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to subsequently retrieve the item.[161]Dogs also demonstrate sophisticated [[Social_cognition]] by associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.[105] One such class of social cognition involves the understanding that others are conscious agents. Research has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.[162] The results showed that domestic dogs were better than [[Chimpanzee]], wolves, and human infants at this task, and even young puppies with limited exposure to humans performed well.[105]Psychology research has shown that humansÂ´ gaze instinctively moves to the left in order to watch the right side of a person's face, which is related to use of right hemisphere brain for facial recognition, including human facial emotions. Research at the [[University_of_Lincoln]] (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such they are the only non-[[Primate]] species known to do so.[163][164][[Stanley_Coren]], an expert on dog psychology, states that these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition that distinguishes the dog from its ancestor, the wolf.[105] Studies have also investigated whether dogs engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending on the attention-state of their partner.[165] Those studies showed that play signals were only sent when the dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in attention-getting behavior before sending a play signal.[165]Coren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including one example wherein a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the room.[105] Although this could have been accidental, Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of view. Together, the empirical data and [[Anecdotal_evidence]] points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of [[Theory_of_mind]].[105][165]A study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when separated from others.[166]A [[Border_Collie]] named Chaser has learned the names for 1,022 toys after three years of training, so many that her trainers have had to mark the names of the objects lest they forget themselves. This is higher than [[Rico_(Border_Collie)]], another border collie who could remember at least 200 objects.[167]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Border_Collie_liver_portrait.jpg/220px-Border_Collie_liver_portrait.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Sergeant_Stubby_3.jpg/220px-Sergeant_Stubby_3.jpg"]},"Behavior":{"text":"Although dogs have been the subject of a great deal of [[Behaviorism]] (e.g. [[Classical_conditioning]]), they do not enter the world with a psychological \"blank slate\".[105] Rather, dog behavior is affected by genetic factors as well as environmental factors.[105] Domestic dogs exhibit a number of behaviors and predispositions that were inherited from wolves.[105]The [[Gray_Wolf]] is a [[Social_animal]] that has evolved a sophisticated means of communication and [[Social_structure]]. The domestic dog has inherited some of these predispositions, but many of the salient characteristics in dog behavior have been largely shaped by selective breeding by humans. Thus some of these characteristics, such as the dog's highly developed [[Social_cognition]], are found only in primitive forms in grey wolves.[162]The existence and nature of personality traits in dogs have been studied (15329 dogs of 164 different breeds) and five consistent and stable \"narrow traits\" identified, described as playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shynessâboldness was also identified.[168][169]The average sleep time of a dog is said to be 10.1 hours per day.[170] Like humans, dogs have two main types of sleep: [[Slow-wave_sleep]], then [[Rapid_eye_movement_sleep]] sleep, the state in which dreams occur.[171]Dogs tend to be poorer than wolves at [[Observational_learning]], being more responsive to [[Operant_conditioning]].[174] Feral dogs show little of the complex social structure or [[Dominance_hierarchy]] present in wolf packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in locating food items, and are more like competitors.[174]Feral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor [[Ungulate]] hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations where they are [[Sympatric_speciation]]. However, feral dogs have been reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the [[Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands]],[175] and free ranging pet dogs are more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.Domestic dogs can be [[Monogamy]].[176] Breeding in feral packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a dominant alpha pair (such things also occur in wolf packs).[177] Male dogs are unusual among canids by the fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females to increase their own reproductive success.[175] Some sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species by the fact that they do not regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other dogs in the same [[Territory_(animal)]].[174]However, this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young as well as care for the young by the males has been observed in domestic dogs, [[Dingo]] as well as in other feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females and direct choosing of only one mate has been observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.[176][178]","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Beagle-Shepard_Mixed-breed_dog_-_Sitting.png/220px-Beagle-Shepard_Mixed-breed_dog_-_Sitting.png"]},"Dog growl":{"text":"A new study in Budapest, Hungary has found that dogs are able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl.
